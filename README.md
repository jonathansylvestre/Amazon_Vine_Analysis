## Overview
The purpose of this project is to analyze the reviews from members and non-members of the Vine program in order to discover if there are biases among the two reviewer types. I chose to focus on the video game data and extacted my data via AWS. I went the PySpark route in order to conduct my analysis.

<p align="center"> The results show a slight bias among members of the Vine program when it comes to meaningful 5-star reviews on video games that they've purchased from Amazon.

## Summary
It appears that members of the Vine program tend to give 5-star ratings at a higher rate than non-members. This may be because members might find incentive in giving higher reviews due this status and also because they're giving more thought to their reviews. Another analysis that I would conduct would be to disregard the filtering for the total count of 20 reviews to see if more data would result in a different outcome.
